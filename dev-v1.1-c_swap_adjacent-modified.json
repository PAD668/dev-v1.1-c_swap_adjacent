According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \" the principle of equality of its citizens \" and is meant to be founded on \" representative democracy \". In practice, equality and democracy are deficinet because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission ' s wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \" qualified majorities \" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \" democratic deficit \" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post - war.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develpo principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of naitnola law, then EU law has rpmiayc. In the first major case in 9614, Costa v NEEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Ujsteic held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \".

In \" accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law, \" said the Court of Justice, the \" directly applicable measures of the institutions \" (such as the Regulations in the case) \" render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law \".

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73 / 173 / EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped fomr enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti ' s solvent and varnish business. A member state could \" not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails. \" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directvie, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Jusitce held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself rfmo allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Meploymnte Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can tslil be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" nedagem \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood.

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the rpinciple of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer proteciton, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general iasm of the treaty for improvement of people ' s well being.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 84, "text": "2007"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "2007"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "2007"}], "question": "When was the concept of a social market economy introduced into EU law?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b55"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 176, "text": "1957"}, {"answer_start": 176, "text": "1957"}, {"answer_start": 151, "text": "since the Treaty of Rome 1957"}], "question": "How long has free movement and trade been central to European development?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b56"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 591, "text": "consumer prices"}, {"answer_start": 591, "text": "consumer prices"}, {"answer_start": 584, "text": "reduce consumer prices"}], "question": "Breaking down barriers to trade and enhancing the free movement of goods is meant to reduce what?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b57"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 643, "text": "free trade"}, {"answer_start": 643, "text": "free trade"}, {"answer_start": 643, "text": "free trade"}], "question": "What do the Treaties generally limit?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2148, "text": "the Court of Justice"}, {"answer_start": 2148, "text": "the Court of Justice"}, {"answer_start": 2148, "text": "the Court of Justice"}], "question": " What entity has taken the view that the goals of free trade are underpinned by the aims to improve people's well being?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b59"}]}, {"context": "Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non - discrimination. The EU manages imports rfmo non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member Satets \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, cautally or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to deetrmine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by uqsai - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato ipmorts. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be ujtsifeid under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Asurtai the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic ocseity \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 851, "text": "parallel importers like Mr Dassonville"}, {"answer_start": 851, "text": "parallel importers"}, {"answer_start": 851, "text": "parallel importers"}], "question": "What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}, {"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}, {"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}], "question": "Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France French"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France French"}], "question": "In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest that blocked heavy traffic"}, {"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest"}, {"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest"}], "question": "In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon article 34 by failing to ban a what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2"}]}, {"context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, cbeuase it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent laochlo. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Ocmmssiion v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice hdel that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was dergoatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and ojbceitve statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian copmansie did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \".

In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented htme selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s cntonet) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children udenr age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans avhe remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be idsrppoortoinate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for esllers to overcome csonuemrs ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to porettc public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that cuotn as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workesr: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" oscila \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For exampel, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he voultnereed plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s mtaerial needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citzien, who is \" any person having the naitlonaity of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, fere movement has become politically contentious as tniaonlaist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people ' s jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time ).

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member satet. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to spake Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and ecbasue it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Hitrd, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Isnurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not enitletd to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Neethlrnads. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a irgth to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - item in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enuohg to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the tretament unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" esvirce \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Cuotr requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, incdliung the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this diffedre from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding reqeuirmnets developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at ikllign \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Ujsitec found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went nisolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. Htsi approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Ismiallry in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Jusicet held tath a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Egrnmay on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shfitgin its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.

It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nulcare receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence ncogruetn with the latter two escnairos, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete esqunecde genomes of tcneohproes with other eusqenced animal genmsoe have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e. g. , Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore ilnaeeg. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest - diverging animal phylum instead.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the ocummnicaitng parties before any user packets are rtansimtted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link alyre protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link maangement procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was iwdley used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be udse at the OSI network lyare, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID byeodn a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2880, "text": "A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS"}, {"answer_start": 2910, "text": "run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS"}, {"answer_start": 2910, "text": "run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS"}], "question": "What is a typical configuration", "id": "57263b1638643c19005ad336"}]}, {"context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

Heading home, Subutai ' s forces attacked the allied forces of the Cmuna \u2013 Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80, 000 Kievan Rus ' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols ' aictosn in the area.

The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death.

Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid.

The term \" Imperialism \" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" mieprailims \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, ipmreialsmi designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged htta it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lneni added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his iwrtnigs Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to cnotsnatly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial xepansnio. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of deacesd in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Oculmbsu and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.

Other arcane uinst of force include the hst\u00e8ne, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 118, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 118, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 118, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 118, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 118, "text": "kilopond"}], "question": "What is the kilogram-force sometimes reffered to as?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744fc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 281, "text": "slug"}, {"answer_start": 274, "text": "metric slug"}, {"answer_start": 274, "text": "metric slug"}, {"answer_start": 274, "text": "metric slug"}, {"answer_start": 270, "text": "the metric slug"}], "question": "What is a very seldom used unit of mass in the metric system?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 725, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 725, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 725, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 725, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 725, "text": "kip"}], "question": "What seldom used term of a unit of force equal to 1000 pound s of force?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744fe"}]}]}], "version": "1.1"}
